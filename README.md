# Phil's Forilicsome Plugins of Impracticality
Looking for top quality SourceMod plugins? You've come to the wrong place!
Enjoy these mischievous scripts I've written over the years I now use to agitate my players.
This is used to serve me pretty much, I never planned on publishing any of these and never will outside this repository.

_NOTE:_ There are more uncomiled sources than plugins.
